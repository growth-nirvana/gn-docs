## Attribution

* Given the changes in performance marketing, we recommend that marketing teams review:
  1. Channel reported data
  2. [First & last click attribution](/amplitude/)
  3. [HDYHAU](/hdyhau/)

* Growth Nirvana generates reports that show the results of these 3 attribution approaches which will allow marketing teams to make more informed decisions
* Relative performance across these approaches will lead to increased ROI by scaling high performing campaigns and eliminating poor performing campaigns
* These three data points can be used as inputs to create a media mix model

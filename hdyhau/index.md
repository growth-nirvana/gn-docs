## How did you hear about us? (HDYHAU)

Direct attribution is becoming challenging given the FB/iOS changes and direction towards a cookie-less world
 * High consideration purchases (ex, B2B) may not show up in click attribution
 * Channels like YouTube performs poorly on click attribution, but may work well for you business
 * Understanding missing attribution is critical in scaling digital marketing channels

Implementation
 * If you are a B2B business with a lead form,
   * We recommend you require collection of “how did you hear about us” on your lead form
   * This data can be stored with your lead
   * Growth Nirvana will pick up this data by automatically connecting with the system you store leads (ex, Hubspot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, etc)
  * If you are a B2C business, 
    * We recommend you collect “how did you hear about us” post-purchase
    * This data can be stored in any system (ex, amplitude/mixpanel, production DB)
    * Growth Nirvana will pick up this data by automatically connecting with the system you store this data
